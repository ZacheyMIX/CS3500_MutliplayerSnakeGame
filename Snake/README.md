### Parkstrikers Snake Client
## Written by Ashton Hunt and Zachery Blomquist as part of CS3500, University of Utah, Fall 2022

# What works:
- thing one
- thing two

# What doesn't work:
- thing three
- thing four

# What we still have to do:
- Create and verify each specified software structured project: ClientWorld, SnakeClient, GameController
- Give default constructors to all model classes
- Get everything that doesn't work working

# Things we tried to remember in development:
- Keeping the model passive
- Install JSON only in projects that use JSON
